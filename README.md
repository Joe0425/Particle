# Particle

A particle tracking module designed for multi-block overset grids [1] is presented here. By integrating the current particle module with an appropriate fluid solver, we can perform direct numerical simulations of particle-laden flows with complex geometries such as turbomachinery flows, and an example of the numerical configuration is shown in the figure below.
