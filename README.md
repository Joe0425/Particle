# Particle

A particle tracking module designed for multi-block overset grids [1] is presented here. By integrating the current particle module with an appropriate fluid solver, we can perform direct numerical simulations of particle-laden flows with complex geometries such as turbomachinery flows, and an example of the numerical configuration is shown in the figure below.

The present module for particle tracking is developed by Mr. Taiyang Wang, who is funded and advised by Prof. Yaomin Zhao from Peking University.

Programming language: Fortran
External libraries: MPI


The main features of this module are summarized:
